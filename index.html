       <h2>A Story about why I stuided film production at college</h2>
       
       <h4>Since I was a little girl, I have been obsessed of arts such as writing, drawing and    music. My sense of art was greatly shaped by taking various training classes, thus I wished that I may one day become a writer, a musician or a painter.  However, this idea also disappointed me a little bit for being the specialist in only one field. 
       <br> How could I embrace them all and involve them all in my future career? Does this career really exist? I have been looking for the answer till I watched Harry Potter and the philosopher’s Stone at the age of 12. 
       <br>I was so amazed by the writer J.K. Rowling who has successfully opened the world of my imagination and creativity. I love everything included in the film, such as the story, the scene composition and the music, which were just the same as my interests.
       <br> Combining my passion for writing, drawing, music and film to pursue a career in the film industry just seems so natural and right for me. Moreover, films have such magic power not only to entertain, but challenge us to broaden our understanding of the world, and the people within it. 
       <br>I could not think of a venture more deserve of my time than a study of film, thus I have kept walking toward my dream career since then.</h4>
       
       <h2>where I come from and where I am going</h2>
       <h4> I come from south part of China, which is called Shenzhen.That is a beautiful coastal city.Shenzhen has the same weather as Miami, humid and heat. I live in Shenzhe for 20 years.I love this city not only because it is my hometown but also becuase it is an energetic and developing city with nice people and beautiful views. <br>
       Now I am in Miami. I study interactive media in University of Miami.For me, interactive media is a totally new field that I can learn something more interesting.
